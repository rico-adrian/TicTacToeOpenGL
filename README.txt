Tic Tac Toe by Kyle Kenney and Rico Adrian

This is a game that uses keyboard presses as input for the screen.
It uses the numbers "1-9" on the keypad for the grid. 

Player one ('X') goes first, and Player Two ('O') goes second. 
The first player to have 3 of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins. 
The game will have an animation after each winner and the game will restart. 
If it is a draw, then the user will get an option to restart by pressing y or n.
